# Labor in Question

An exploratory three.js video game addressing the identity of an industrial worker in post-soviet Karelia. Space, sound and objects are the result of reflection on the collected memories of the workers of the Onega Tractor Plant. The player can reimagine the world of state-owned factory labor, from utopian fairy tales about the future, to the decline of the beginning of capitalism.
